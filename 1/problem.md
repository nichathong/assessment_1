# Find a User by ID

You are given a list of `user_IDs` in the form of integers sorted in ascending order. You want to quickly find a specific user. Create a function that allows you to quickly search for this `id`, returning its index if present or -1 if not.

Ensure your algorithm works for large test cases.

## **Example 1:**
```
Input: user_IDs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], id = 3
Output: 2
```

## **Example 2:**
```
Input: user_IDs = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], id = 7
Output: -1
```
