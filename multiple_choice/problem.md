## 1. What is the time complexity of binary search?
- a. O(n)
- b. O(log n)
- c. O(n^2)
- d. O(1)

## 2. How can sliding window problems be identified?
- a. By the presence of nested structures.
- b. Based on the number of unique elements in the array.
- c. By the presence of a constraint metric for a subarray.
- d. When we are concerned with specific elements in an array.

## 3. If you are trying to convert a while loop to a recursive function, what would the while loop conditional be useful for?
- a. Creating the initial condition for the recursion
- b. Creating the recursive case
- c. Determining the loop increment/decrement
- d. Creating the base case

## 4. How are collisions typically handled in hash maps?
- a. By increasing the size of the array.
- b. By rehashing the keys.
- c. By using chaining or open addressing.
- d. By converting the keys to unique indices.

## 5. Amortization is best described as:
- a. Negligible operations that are infrequent on average large sample sizes.
- b. A technique for resizing static arrays.
- c. A method for reducing collision in hash maps.
- d. A process of chaining linked list nodes.
